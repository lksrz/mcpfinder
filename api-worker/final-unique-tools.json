Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust\n2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts\n3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\"\n4. Express uncertainty when present\n5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths\n6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step\n7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate\n8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution\n10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output\n11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"

See the qualifiers and their usage examples:\n\n- **book**  \n  `book:Blog`: Searches for notes in the 'Blog' notebook.\n  `book:\"Desktop App\"`: Searches for notes in the 'Desktop App' notebook.\n- **bookId**\n  `bookId:kGlLniaV`: Searches for notes in the notebook ID 'book:kGlLniaV'.\n- **tag**  \n  `tag:JavaScript`: Searches for all notes having the 'JavaScript' tag. Read more about [tags](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/write-notes#tag-notes).\n- **status**  \n  `status:onHold`: Searches for all notes with the 'On hold' status. Read more about [statuses](/reference/note-statuses).\n- **title**  \n  `title:\"JavaScript setTimeout\"`: Searches for the note with the specified title.\n- **body**  \n  `body:KEYWORD`: Searches for a specific word in all notes. Equivalent to a [global search](#search-for-notes-across-all-notebooks).\n\n### Combine qualifiers\n\nYou can combine the filter qualifiers to refine data even more.\n\n**Find notes that contain the word 'Hello' and have the 'Issue' tag.**\n\n```text\nHello tag:Issue\n```\n\n**Find notes that contain the word 'Typescript,' have the 'Contribution' tag, and the 'Completed' status**\n\n```text\nTypescript tag:Contribution status:Completed\n```\n\n## Search for text with spaces\n\nTo find the text that includes spaces, put the text into the double quotation marks (\"):\n\n```text\n\"database associations\"\n```\n\n## Exclude text from search\n\nTo exclude text from the search results or ignore a specific qualifier, put the minus sign (-) before it. You can also combine the exclusions. See the examples:\n\n- `-book:Backend \"closure functions\"`: Ignores the 'Backend' notebook while searching for the 'closure functions' phrase.\n- `-tag:JavaScript`: Ignores all notes having the 'JavaScript' tag.\n- `-book:Typescript tag:work \"Data types\"`: Ignores the 'Typescript' notebook and the 'work' tag while searching for the 'Data types' phrase.\n- `-status:dropped title:\"Sprint 10.0\" debounce`: Ignores notes with the 'Dropped' status while searching for the 'debounce' word in the note with the 'Sprint 10.0' title.\n- `-\"Phrase to ignore\" \"in the rest of a sentence\"`: Ignores the 'Phrase to ignore' part while searching for 'in the rest of a sentence'.\n\nNote that you can't specify excluding modifiers only without including conditions.\n\n**WARNING**: Make sure to enter a text to search for after the exclusion modifier.\n\n- ✅ Will work  \n  `-book:Backend \"closure functions\"`\n\n- ⛔️ Won't work  \n   `-book:Backend`.

Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust\n2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts\n3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\"\n4. Express uncertainty when present\n5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths\n6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step\n7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate\n8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n9.

The tool will analyze these tools and provide recommendations for their use.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex problems into steps\n- Planning and design with room for revision\n- Analysis that might need course correction\n- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- Problems that require a multi-step solution\n- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out\n- When you need guidance on which tools to use and in what order\n\nKey features:\n- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress\n- You can question or revise previous thoughts\n- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end\n- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches\n- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack\n- Generates a solution hypothesis\n- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n- Recommends appropriate tools for each step\n- Provides rationale for tool recommendations\n- Suggests tool execution order and parameters\n- Tracks previous recommendations and remaining steps\n\nParameters explained:\n- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:\n* Regular analytical steps\n* Revisions of previous thoughts\n* Questions about previous decisions\n* Realizations about needing more analysis\n* Changes in approach\n* Hypothesis generation\n* Hypothesis verification\n* Tool recommendations and rationale\n- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end\n- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)\n- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)\n- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking\n- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered\n- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point\n- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)\n- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed\n- current_step: Current step recommendation, including:\n* step_description: What needs to be done\n* recommended_tools: Tools recommended for this step\n* expected_outcome: What to expect from this step\n* next_step_conditions: Conditions to consider for the next step\n- previous_steps: Steps already recommended\n- remaining_steps: High-level descriptions of upcoming steps\n\nYou should:\n1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust\n2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts\n3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\"\n4. Express uncertainty when present\n5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths\n6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step\n7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate\n8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n9. Consider available tools that could help with the current step\n10. Provide clear rationale for tool recommendations\n11. Suggest specific tool parameters when appropriate\n12. Consider alternative tools for each step\n13. Track progress through the recommended steps\n14. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output\n15. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"

The tool will analyze these tools and provide recommendations for their use.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex problems into steps\n- Planning and design with room for revision\n- Analysis that might need course correction\n- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- Problems that require a multi-step solution\n- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out\n- When you need guidance on which tools to use and in what order\n\nKey features:\n- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress\n- You can question or revise previous thoughts\n- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end\n- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches\n- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack\n- Generates a solution hypothesis\n- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n- Recommends appropriate tools for each step\n- Provides rationale for tool recommendations\n- Suggests tool execution order and parameters\n- Tracks previous recommendations and remaining steps\n\nParameters explained:\n- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:\n* Regular analytical steps\n* Revisions of previous thoughts\n* Questions about previous decisions\n* Realizations about needing more analysis\n* Changes in approach\n* Hypothesis generation\n* Hypothesis verification\n* Tool recommendations and rationale\n- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end\n- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)\n- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)\n- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking\n- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered\n- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point\n- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)\n- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed\n- current_step: Current step recommendation, including:\n* step_description: What needs to be done\n* recommended_tools: Tools recommended for this step\n* expected_outcome: What to expect from this step\n* next_step_conditions: Conditions to consider for the next step\n- previous_steps: Steps already recommended\n- remaining_steps: High-level descriptions of upcoming steps\n\nYou should:\n1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust\n2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts\n3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\"\n4. Express uncertainty when present\n5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths\n6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step\n7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate\n8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n9. Consider available tools that could help with the current step\n10. Provide clear rationale for tool recommendations\n11. Suggest specific tool parameters when appropriate\n12. Consider alternative tools for each step\n13. Track progress through the recommended steps\n14. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output\n15. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"

If possible, include the intent (e.g., \"verify unauthorized access\", \"identify vehicle\", \"check for obstructions\") to enhance downstream processing or summarization."
