You will also lose 1000 points for each single tool call. </!WARNING!>\n  \n  \"Error executing code: Cannot convert undefined or null to object\" as a response means that you had a syntax error in your JSON.\n  The batch MCP server sees an empty object, which cause this error message. Fix the syntax error and try again. \n  "
