      "description": "**Unified Cognitive Process (Mandatory):** This is your REQUIRED tool for ALL internal cognitive steps, enforcing the **Observe-Orient-Reason-Decide-Act (OOReDAct)** cycle. Use `stage: \"orient\"` for the MANDATORY initial assessment (Complexity, Uncertainty, Consequence, Novelty - CUC-N) and OOReDAct Observe/Orient steps at the start of ANY task or strategic pivot. Use `stage: \"reason\"` for the MANDATORY full OOReDAct deliberation cycle after receiving new information (tool/CodeAct results, errors, USER input) and BEFORE any non-trivial action or final response. Within the 'Reason' stage, adapt your reasoning style for optimal performance: employ **Chain-of-Thought** (step-by-step natural language reasoning for complex problems, enhancing accuracy), **Chain-of-Draft/Condensed Reasoning** (iterative refinement or concise steps for efficiency), or **Structured Chain-of-Thought** (reasoning that explicitly incorporates program structures, plans, or structured steps, particularly effective for code generation and structured tasks). Use `stage: \"acknowledge\"` ONLY for brief acknowledgements of simple, expected outcomes where the next step is already clearly defined by a prior 'reason' stage and needs NO re-evaluation. Use `stage: \"sandbox\"` to log the MANDATORY internal `<sandbox>` simulation (Hypothesis Testing, Constraint Checks, Confidence Scoring, Pre-computation, etc.) BEFORE any non-trivial output, plan, decision, or action, as per operational directives. This tool acts as a passthrough, returning the provided content verbatim."
