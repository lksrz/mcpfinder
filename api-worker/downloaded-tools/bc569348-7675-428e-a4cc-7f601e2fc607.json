      "description": "List all notes that contain a given keyword.\nThe result does not include entire note bodies as they are truncated in 200 characters.\nYou have to retrieve the full note content by calling `read-note`.\nHere are tips to specify keywords effectively:\n\n## Use special qualifiers to narrow down results\n\nYou can use special qualifiers to get more accurate results. See the qualifiers and their usage examples:\n\n- **book**  \n  `book:Blog`: Searches for notes in the 'Blog' notebook.\n  `book:\"Desktop App\"`: Searches for notes in the 'Desktop App' notebook.\n- **bookId**\n  `bookId:kGlLniaV`: Searches for notes in the notebook ID 'book:kGlLniaV'.\n- **tag**  \n  `tag:JavaScript`: Searches for all notes having the 'JavaScript' tag. Read more about [tags](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/write-notes#tag-notes).\n- **status**  \n  `status:onHold`: Searches for all notes with the 'On hold' status. Read more about [statuses](/reference/note-statuses).\n- **title**  \n  `title:\"JavaScript setTimeout\"`: Searches for the note with the specified title.\n- **body**  \n  `body:KEYWORD`: Searches for a specific word in all notes. Equivalent to a [global search](#search-for-notes-across-all-notebooks).\n\n### Combine qualifiers\n\nYou can combine the filter qualifiers to refine data even more.\n\n**Find notes that contain the word 'Hello' and have the 'Issue' tag.**\n\n```text\nHello tag:Issue\n```\n\n**Find notes that contain the word 'Typescript,' have the 'Contribution' tag, and the 'Completed' status**\n\n```text\nTypescript tag:Contribution status:Completed\n```\n\n## Search for text with spaces\n\nTo find the text that includes spaces, put the text into the double quotation marks (\"):\n\n```text\n\"database associations\"\n```\n\n## Exclude text from search\n\nTo exclude text from the search results or ignore a specific qualifier, put the minus sign (-) before it. You can also combine the exclusions. See the examples:\n\n- `-book:Backend \"closure functions\"`: Ignores the 'Backend' notebook while searching for the 'closure functions' phrase.\n- `-tag:JavaScript`: Ignores all notes having the 'JavaScript' tag.\n- `-book:Typescript tag:work \"Data types\"`: Ignores the 'Typescript' notebook and the 'work' tag while searching for the 'Data types' phrase.\n- `-status:dropped title:\"Sprint 10.0\" debounce`: Ignores notes with the 'Dropped' status while searching for the 'debounce' word in the note with the 'Sprint 10.0' title.\n- `-\"Phrase to ignore\" \"in the rest of a sentence\"`: Ignores the 'Phrase to ignore' part while searching for 'in the rest of a sentence'.\n\nNote that you can't specify excluding modifiers only without including conditions.\n\n**WARNING**: Make sure to enter a text to search for after the exclusion modifier.\n\n- ✅ Will work  \n  `-book:Backend \"closure functions\"`\n\n- ⛔️ Won't work  \n   `-book:Backend`. There's no query. Inkdrop doesn't understand what to search for.\n    "
