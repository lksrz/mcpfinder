/**
 * Search relevance regression suite.
 *
 * These checks pin ranking, not plumbing. They exist because a name-match boost
 * that fired on the reverse-DNS hosting prefix (`io.github.<owner>/<repo>`) made
 * `search_mcp_servers("github")` return five servers with nothing to do with
 * GitHub — NIST NVD, OpenAlex, arXiv, PubMed, OpenStreetMap — while the catalog
 * held three genuine GitHub servers. On the 89,840-row snapshot of 2026-08-27,
 * 19.6% of names start with `io.github.`, so 94.0% of the 19,129 hits for
 * "github" collected the full +5.0 boost (98.0% of those purely via the prefix)
 * and the boost degenerated into a constant. Nothing in the test suite noticed.
 *
 * The corpora below are built in code, small enough to reason about by hand, and
 * shaped to reproduce that collision: `<prefix><owner>/<not-github>` decoys with
 * high `use_count` against one genuine, less-used match.
 *
 * What these checks pin, and what they cannot:
 *
 * Stripping is *reliably* observable only when the query term occurs **in the
 * prefix itself**. The boost is an unanchored `LIKE '%term%'`, so cutting
 * `io.github.` off `io.github.cyanheads/orcid-server` changes nothing for the
 * term "orcid" — it matches either way. Any check meant to go red when a prefix
 * entry is deleted is therefore built around "github" or "smithery", the words
 * that live inside the prefixes.
 *
 * There is a second, unreliable channel, and it is worth naming so nobody
 * mistakes it for coverage: the detail scorer ranks by `indexOf`, so changing
 * how many characters are cut — including cutting none at all — shifts every
 * positional score in the JS path, even for a leaf term. That flips a result
 * only when two candidates sit within the shift of each other, which is a
 * property of the fixture's arithmetic rather than of the code under test. Some
 * mutations here die that way (the "cyanheads" edge fixture kills a wholesale
 * deletion of the `io.github.` rule by one point); others survive. Build new
 * checks on the first channel and treat the second as a bonus.
 *
 * On that basis every branch of the table is exercised, in both the SQL path
 * (`searchServers`) and the JS path (`findServerByNameOrSlug`):
 *   - `io.github.` / `ai.smithery/` / `ai.smithery.` in names
 *   - `io-github-` / `ai-smithery-` in slugs, and *not* in names
 *   - upper-case spellings, which SQLite `LIKE` folds and `startsWith` does not
 *
 * The accepted cost, asserted here in that direction: `ai.smithery/brave-search`
 * can no longer win the query "smithery" against a server genuinely named for
 * smithing, because its only "smithery" is provenance.
 *
 * The offsets are pinned unevenly, verified by mutation:
 *   - cutting one character too many is caught in both paths — the first real
 *     character of the leaf disappears and the token stops matching;
 *   - cutting one too few is caught in the JS path only, and only incidentally:
 *     the leftover `.` shifts every positional score by one, which the
 *     case-folding fixture below notices because its margin happens to be one
 *     point. Do not rely on it; it is not what that fixture is for.
 *   - cutting one too few in the SQL path is invisible and no fixture here can
 *     change that. The character left behind is the prefix's own `.` or `/`,
 *     and an unanchored `LIKE '%term%'` does not care what precedes the match.
 *     Saying so beats advertising coverage that does not exist.
 *
 * Several checks pit a fixture against a competitor whose score is a couple of
 * points worse, and spell that arithmetic out. That is deliberate: some of these
 * defects are latent (a wrong `stripHostingPrefix` on an upper-case *name* is
 * masked by the slug, which is always lower-case), and a test that only pins a
 * user-visible symptom would not catch them.
